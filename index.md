## Welcome!

This site lists out the Tableau Web Data Connectors I have written and made available for use.  At this time I am working on the following Web Data Connectors.

## Quality Payment Program Measures

The Quality Payment Program APIs allow for connecting to the following data:
- Quality Measures
- ACI Measures
- Improvement Activities

At this time, only the Improvement Activities list is complete.

You can try it out by specifying the below URL in your Web Data Connector in Tableau (version 10.1 or newer).

[http://jschuhdodge.github.io/html/connector.html](http://jschuhdodge.github.io/html/connector.html)

As time permits I will work on improving this site and these connectors.
